# ATRI-AI-Assignment
A feedforward neural network that was created from the ground up to classify images on the Fashion-MNIST dataset is fully implemented in this repository. The model is implemented entirely in Python using numerical operations based on NumPy.
The neural network's fundamental operations, such as forward propagation, backpropagation, loss computation, and parameter updates, are all manually coded and do not rely on high-level deep learning abstractions or automatic differentiation.
Instead of relying on pre-built frameworks, the project places an emphasis on comprehending the internal workings of neural network training. To examine performance in various configurations, a number of experiments are carried out and  monitored using Weights & Biases (wandb).
